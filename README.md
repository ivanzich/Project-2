User Stories

-As a user I want to connect on the website (Soundcloud) so I can login with my username and password.

-As a user I want to listen available soundclips and see if I can come with my musical idea. 

-As a user I need to download an audio file so I can do further edits and recordings on the top of the original idea.

-As a user I will upload my musical idea in the format of .mp3 .wav or any other supported audio files so other users can have a listen try to come up with their musical parts.

Application description and technologies used:

Website represents a database/place where electronic musicians using only synthesizer exchange and collaborate on their musical ideas.

Collaborations workflow would be where user 1 would upload his/her musical idea as isolated track (ie. drum beat, Bass line, background part(s) etc.

Musical loops would be stored on soundcloud or beatport or googledrive and be available for free download for other interested collaborators. Synth Sound Library would serve as database platform where users basically exchange sounds  and collaborate on each other's musical projects. Users would decide what software they want to use outside of this platform (Cubase,GarageBand, ProTools etc.) for editing purposes.
